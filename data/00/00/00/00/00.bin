  |   Make sure to install Update v1.0.2 to enable DLC compability,         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Episode 4 DLC needs to be installed on the main game with Title ID    |
  |   010060F00AA70000. That release did not contain ALL EPISODES!          |
  |   The base game only contains Episode 1.                                |
  |   We have previously released Episode 2 + 3 as DLC with all additional  |
  |   audio language files and subtitles. Make sure to grab it if you       |
  |   want all languages on previously released Episodes 1, 2 and 3.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The original EP1 release failed to include the downloadable content   |
  |   for the additional languages. These languages would not work without  |
  |   an active internet connection and owning the legit game to verify     |
  |   with the servers.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Episode 4:                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now you can enjoy Episode 4 with all the extra languages/subtitles:   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Audio: English, French and German.                                    |
  |   Currently Telltales don't provide neither Spanish nor Portuguese.     |
  |   At this time - it is unknown if they make them available later.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Subtitles: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish,     |
  |   Chinese and Traditional Chinese.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   If you haven't installed our previous Episode 2 and 3 DLC yet:        |
  |   As a bonus in our previous Episode DLC we have included all the       |
  |   necessary content to enable audio and subtitles of foreign languages  |
  |   for all previous Episodes.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Our new release only contains Episode 4 and all its additional files  |
  |                                                                         |
